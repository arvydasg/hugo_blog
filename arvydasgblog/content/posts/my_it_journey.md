## June 23rd 2022 - Promotion

Offered to be promoted to IT Engineer, manager agreed. Exactly a month
later was told that that's not going to happen.

## June 19th 2022 - Want to code

Tired of running though the factory fixing printers - want to program
again.

## April 11th 2022 - First IT job

Starting my first IT job ever as an IT Technician in my home town
Panevezys.

## Sep 2021 - Self employed web dev

Making wordpress sites for clients. Initially with Elementor, then
oxygen builder, but at the end realizing that all those builders are
not for me, I want to code. That is when I started building various
sites with django.

Got hooked on emacs. I am not going back to any other code editor. It
is everything, my code editor, my text reader, my calendar, my to-do
tool, my note taking app, my second brain, my website… and so on.

## January 2021 - Going all in

Starting to learn programming with Machine learning course on
Coursera. Trying to find the best code editor.. trying out
[VIM](https://www.vim.org/) and loving it. So many shortcuts - I can
jump though things swiftly. Feels like
[Revit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autodesk_Revit) or some kind of
video game([World of
Warcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft)).

Doing code in place python project.

Deciding that I also don't want to use Windows as my primary operating
system. Switching to Linux. Trying out different distros, installing
and reinstalling them dozen of times… finally settling down with
Ubuntu.


## April 2020 - The idea to program

Quarantine in Bali. Lying in bed. Realizing that I would like to have
a job I can do remotely. I was a computer guy my whole life, playing
mostly, but also fixing minor problems.. Never calling an IT guy to
fix something - always doing it myself.
