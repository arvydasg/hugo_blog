# Intro

For the last year I was trying to get myself to do some blogging. I
know that I like documenting.. I liked that since I was young.
Collecting photos that I took, saving the old documents or notes..
just so I could refer to them when I am older or show to someone that
is interested.

# Body
## First attempts

I was trying to do the same with my journey to programming. It started
a bit more than a year ago and since them I was trying to create
personal blog/website.

* First with php - [gvazdikelis](https://github.com/arvydasg/gvazdikelis)
* Then with hugo - [arvydas.dev_hugo](https://github.com/arvydasg/arvydas.dev_hugo)
* Finally with django -
  [django_blog](https://github.com/arvydasg/django_blog)
  
And some plain html blogs/personal websites ones in between those
mentioned above.

None of those methods stuck to me, even though they are know to be
easy to set up and run, but not for me.

## Current setup

[2022-04-17 Sk] I discovered a way to make a website with emacs.
[Systemcrafters channel](https://systemcrafters.net/publishing-websites-with-org-mode/) has a lot of great material covering just that.

I knew that this is the right way for me to blog, because:

* I can use my emacs shortcuts to write and edit text,
* I don't need to reformat text to make it readable for something like
  CKEditor in python [django](https://github.com/arvydasg/emacs_blog). I can just straight up use emacs source
  blocks, headings, text blocks and so on and everything just works,
* I can publish my blog just as easily wit [Magit](https://magit.vc/), push straight to
  [Github](https://github.com/arvydasg/gvazdikelis) and the changes will be visible immediately in my website,

# Summary

For me, this is the fastest way to blog. I will be using it in the
future and hopefully improve my workflow as I go along.

P.S. Update 2022-08-29. I am creating a hugo blog - AGAIN. Read why - [here](https://github.com/arvydasg/emacs_blog).
