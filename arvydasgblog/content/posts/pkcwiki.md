# What is it for

When I came to PKC - there was very little documentation about IT
processes. It had to be documented. 

As I was already using Emacs for documenting my work with
[Org-roam](https://www.orgroam.com/), I simply had to make a website
for it. The website itself was generated thanks to [this piece of
code](https://github.com/arvydasg/pkc_wiki). 

I then put this website(html files) on server that is accessible to
colleagues so they can get inspiration whenever needed.

This project was mainly focused to my future colleagues.
