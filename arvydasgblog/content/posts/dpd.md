# What is it for

This project was created by me for me, with an idea to share it with
my colleagues at https://www.dpd.com/lt/lt The couriers are not happy
with their salaries, they are not sure if they are calculated properly
according to many factors that DPD tells about. This leads to couriers
writing down numbers of packages they have delivered, collected,
kilometers they have driven and so on.. Every day, after each shift.
And all this additional work and accounting because they can not trust
their employers. I thought I will create this app so it can be used by
couriers to track their data easier and in one place.

# How it works

A user logs in, gets a posibility to add a daily record with all the
needed options for a courier. When he is done, a record is saved. It
can also be edited if needed right on the website, no need to go to
the django admin.

This is a django app that is hosted on github and heroku.

# Summary

Nice and useful little app. Would still be using it if I was working
in DPD still.
