After a few months of **CodeAcademy "Front-end + Python program"**
course (2022-07 - 2023.03), I can say that I have repeated a lot of
what I have already knew and been using (HTML,CSS) and I have learned
even more new things with the JavaScript part of the course.

As you might know I like to document things... mainly to track my own
progress or just to have things as a reference **just int case**, or
just to share stuff with others. No matter where I am and what is the
task, I document. It's quite a lot of work, but sometimes, it pays
off - here is an example [PKCwiki](https://arvydas.dev/posts/pkcwiki/)
;)

This case is no different, I documented everything that I learned
during this course. Most of the tasks, most of the examples, most of
my own experiments during the course.

## HTML/CSS part 2022-07 - 2022-09
All of the stuff from that part can be accessed and inspected
[Here](https://arvydas.dev/codeacademy/). Github repo, if needed, is [Here](https://github.com/arvydasg/codeacademy).

## JavaScript part 2022-09 - now
All of the stuff from that part(with code) can be accessed and
inspected
[Here](https://arvydas.dev/codeacademy/javascript/index.html). Github
repo, if needed, is
[Here](https://github.com/arvydasg/codeacademy/tree/master/javascript).

Hope I managed to present my work in a easy to read manner.
