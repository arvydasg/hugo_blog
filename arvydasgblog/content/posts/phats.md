# What is it for 


* A program called Wise exports an excel document with lots of part
  numbers.
* My script takes this excel document, removes unnecessary part
  numbers(defined in another file) and outputs a .txt file that I can
  later use for software called PHATS. This tool is crucial, prevents
  a lot of manual labor.

Making functions.py file [as an
executable](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZX5kH72Yx4&t) so it is
more convenient for operators to use this script(double click it and go).
