# Introduction

2022-10-13 I had a final front-end part
[Codeacademy](https://arvydas.dev/posts/codeacademy/) task. I was asked to
use GET, POST and DELETE requests while taking design and layout inspirations
from [skelbiu.lt](https://www.skelbiu.lt/). 

The goal was not to use any javascript frameworks. I have also used as
much pure html/css as possible, although for the form, I have decided
to use Bootstrap.

Here is a codeacademy task itself - [Baigiamoji uzduotis](Baigiamoji_uzduotis.pdf).

# The process

- I have started with researching the
  [skelbiu.lt](https://www.skelbiu.lt/) page, figuring out how much of
  the cloning I can do from it.
- I then created an API for the project with
  [mockapi](https://mockapi.io/) and filled it with some dummy data.
- Using the dummy data I have coded the GET, POST, DELETE requests
  with Vanilla Javascrip, not using any frameworks and made sure they
  are displayed in the browser.
- Assigned localstorage values to each item so I can redirect to
  individual item pages.
- Made sure the styles match those of skelbiu.lt

# Conclusion

Here is a link to my [Skelbiu.lt
clone](https://arvydas.dev/codeacademy/javascript/skelbiult/index.html)(give
it a few seconds to load, api is sometimes slow :) ).

Working with API's, fetchign and updating data is one of the most
intersting things that I have done with JavaScript so far. I am happy
I have learned this skill, I can see many project ideas that can be
done in a similar passion, with API's and GET, POST requests, I just
wish I had more time to play with these :)
